# MongoDB Data Preprocessing (NoSQL)

### ‚úÖ Why MongoDB?

We used MongoDB because:
- The raw dataset was **semi-structured JSON** with nested fields
- MongoDB handles **documents (JSON-like)** efficiently
- Many irrelevant columns were dropped inside MongoDB ‚Üí reduced file size BEFORE exporting
- Easier schema flexibility for large (70 columns) dataset without strict relational schema

Even though final output was a structured CSV ‚Üí MongoDB allowed **exploratory, schema-less preprocessing**.
